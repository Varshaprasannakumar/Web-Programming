<h4> Software engineering is the branch of computer science  <br> that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications <br> Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users .<br>

Software engineers design and develop computer games, business applications, operating systems, network control systems, and middleware—to name just a few of the many career paths available.<br> A career as a software engineer can be both fun and challenging with opportunities to work in almost any industry, including large and small businesses, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, healthcare facilities, and more. And as technology continues to evolve, the need for software developers continues to grow.<br> Many companies are also shifting towards hiring software engineers who work from home, allowing for increased flexibility and more opportunities to enter the field.  

Applications developers design computer applications, such as games, for consumers. They may create custom software for a specific customer or commercial software to be sold to the general public.<br> Some applications developers create databases or programs for use internally or online.
Systems developers create operating systems, either for the public or for an organization. These operating systems keep computers functioning and control most of the consumer electronics in use today, including those in cell phones and cars. <br>  Often, systems developers also build the interface that allows users to interact with the computer.
Of course, applications and systems developer jobs are not the only two positions available in the field of software engineering. <br> Other common roles include mobile developers, applications architects, quality assurance analysts, and database administrators.

Successful software engineers use programming languages, platforms, and architectures to develop everything from computer games to network control systems.<br> In addition to building their own systems, software engineers also test, improve, and maintain software built by other engineers.
Thanks to strong industry demand and their own technical expertise, skilled software engineers are well compensated for the value they deliver.<br>The mean annual salary for software developers was $132,930 in May 2022.
Software developers design software to help solve problems faced by real people. <br> This requires a combination of both technical and soft skills. <br>
 A bachelor’s degree in computer science, software engineering, or a related degree program is the most common entry-level requirement for software engineers.<br>
 With our ever-increasing dependency on technology and the growing internet of things, the future of software engineering is bright. <br> Software engineers are employable in nearly every industry, in both large and small organizations.
Michigan Technological University’s College of Computing is the first college in Michigan fully dedicated to computing, and one of only a few nationwide.<br> Secure your future in software engineering with a degree from Michigan’s flagship technological university.<br>
Michigan Tech’s ABET-accredited Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering is consistently <br>ranked among the top ten undergraduate software engineering programs in the country. Our curriculum provides a foundation in computer science during the first two years followed <br> by specialized training for software engineers during the final two years focusing on both the practical and technical sides of software.
Opportunities to explore software engineering outside the classroom are numerous at Michigan Tech. You might choose to join a computing-focused Enterprise team or student organization, seek out research opportunities with faculty members, or develop an independent project.<br>
 With an entire College dedicated to computing, you’re sure to find your people and form lasting connections while exploring your passion for computing.<br>
 When you graduate from Tech, you’ll be in demand by employers. 100 percent of our software engineering graduates are employed within six months of graduation. <br>
  Their employers include major companies such as American Express, Argonne National Laboratory, Boeing, Blue Cross Blue Shield, General Electric, Google, Lockheed Martin, Motorola, Texas Instruments, the US Air Force, and more.<br>
 If you’re still deciding which computer science focus you want to pursue, the first-year undergraduate General Computing program <br> 
gives you one or two semesters to explore the discipline and decide which degree program sparks your curiosity the most. It's a starting point to give you some space to choose the computing field that fits you the best.<br>

The Michigan Tech Master of Applied Computer Science prepares students to apply computing within their chosen application domain. Graduates of the program will identify and apply principles in computer science to develop a rigorous solution to a problem in their application domain.<br>
The program is designed for students who are completing a B.S. degree in a field outside of computer science and who wish to add computing credentials to their B.S. degree.<br>
 Other students may also benefit by completing the M.S. in Applied Computer Science. Please consult with the program director or your advisor.<br>
 The M.S. in Applied Computer Science requires 30 hours of coursework, which can be completed on campus in three to four semesters. Students complete the degree program through a Coursework or a Report option.<br>
 Advances in data collection and analysis and ever-increasing computational power and availability mean that that computers are being used in to solve problems in countless new ways.<br>
 The rigorous application of computing to solve problems in another science, or virtually any domain, requires foundational and advanced knowledge in both computer science and the application domain.<br>
 Graduate programs in the Michigan Tech Department of Computer Science pave the way to exciting, well-compensated career opportunities. You'll be well-prepared through Michigan Tech's high-quality educational experience, which blends fundamentals, cutting-edge technologies, and innovative research.<br>
 Our students and graduates are in high demand by state, national, and international companies. And our alumni are active throughout the nation and worldwide, developing innovative technologies and solving hard multidisciplinary problems. <br>
 Computer Science faculty and students apply computational approaches to solve significant hardware, software, and data problems across a wide range of disciplines.<br>
 Students have many rich opportunities to conduct leading-edge research in a friendly, collegial atmosphere. You will find us working on research in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, big data, internet of things, biometrics, computer and network security, human-computer interaction, and more.<br>
 Four faculty members and an alumnus have received prestigious NSF CAREER Awards.Alumni hold faculty positions at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, University of Houston, and University of Rochester, among others.<br>
 Our graduates are employed in a range of industries, including Amazon, AMD, Ford, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Intel, Qualcomm, Raytheon, Texas Instruments, and more.<br>
